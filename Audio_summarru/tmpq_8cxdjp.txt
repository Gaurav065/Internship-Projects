I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man
I'm not a man, I'm not a man
Light them up, light them up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
It's something I had some red lights
I'm shooting stars to break my heart
Calling you now, you're not picking up
Shadows so close, it's fast to love
Let them miss, let them miss, baby in the dark
Show me where you are
Paula, how much you have seen the day
When I see you on those streets
The Paula, tell me there's a river
Cause when you never bring your back to me
Cause I don't know why to love someone else
I don't know why to forget your face
Paula, how much you have seen the day
So far
It's breakin' me, I'm losing you
We move far from perfect, we'll be what worth it
So many fights, and we grab and never settle sorry
So I'm saying you love me, calling me now
But I can't pick up, it's shut up so close, and I'm still in love
Let them miss, let them miss, over now
Somehow it still breaks my heart, you could have had to stop
Paula, how much you have seen the day
When I see you on those streets
Paula, tell me there's a river
Cause when you never bring your back to me
Cause I don't know why to love someone else
I don't know why to forget your face
Paula, how much you have seen the day
So far
So far away
So far away
So far away
