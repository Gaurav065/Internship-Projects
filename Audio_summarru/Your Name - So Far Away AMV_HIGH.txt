Eunhyuk
The letter melts, the letter melts baby in the dark
Showing you where you want
The ballerara, the harmin she waves to the day
We're gonna see you on both ships
The ballerara, tell me there's a river
Cause when you never bring you back to me
Cause I don't know why to love someone else
I don't know why to fork it, it's your face
No I love, I gotta miss you if you sing a day night
So far
It's breakin' me, I'm losing you
We move far from perfect, but we were worth it
So many fights and we cry but never settle sorry
I'm saying you love me, you calling me now
But I can't pick up, you shed us too close and I still love
The summer's over now, somehow it still breaks my heart
You could have had to stop
The ballerara, how are you singing a day when I see you on both ships
The ballerara, tell me there's a river
Cause when you never bring you back to me
Cause I don't know why to love someone else
I don't know why to fork it, it's your face
No I love, I gotta miss you if you sing a day night
So far
Oh, the summer away
So far away
