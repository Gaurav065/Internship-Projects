This pandemic has shaken up the status quo, and laid bare a lot of our countries' deep-seated problems,
from massive economic inequality to ongoing racial disparities to a lack of basic health care
for people who need it. It's woken a lot of young people up to the fact that the old ways of doing
things just don't work. That it doesn't matter how much money you make if everyone around you is
hungry and sick, and that our society and our democracy only work when we think not just about
ourselves but about each other. You know, all those adults that used to think were in charge and
knew what they were doing turns out they don't have all the answers. A lot of them aren't even asking
the right questions. So if the world's going to get better, it's going to be up to you because with
so much uncertainty, with everything suddenly up for grabs, this is your generation's world to shape.
America's gone through tough times before. Slavery, civil war, famine, disease, the Great Depression,
in 9-11. And each time we came out stronger, usually because a new generation, young people like you
learn from past mistakes and figure out how to make things better. Doing what feels good,
what's convenient, what's easy, that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called
grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way, which is
why things are so screwed up. But if we're going to get through these difficult times,
if we're going to create a world where everybody has opportunity to find a job and afford college,
if we're going to save the environment and defeat future pandemics, then we're going to have to do
it together. So be alive to one another's struggles. Stand up for one another's rights.
Leave behind all the old ways of thinking, the divided sexism, racial prejudice, status, greed,
and set the world on a different path. The truth is, you don't need us to tell you what to do
because in so many ways, you've already started to lead. Congratulations, Class of 2020.
Keep making us proud.
