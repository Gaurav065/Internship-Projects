SO as earlier all the libs are already installed, just installation of the streamlit lib is needed

run pip install streamlit to install the streamlit lib

now we have to apps one for only audio and one for both video and audio

there are some deafult file that are already inculded in the folder


just to note that this is made for speech and podcasts so some of the music audios and video wont work
because our model is not trained to do so dont  try to upload music video we won get summary for them but
will get the text converstion for them

to run only for audio
type stremalit run app.py in the terminal

Now to run for both audio and video files use the updated_app.py note only mp4 and mp3 formats are supported

there is an example of the music video also that can be used to make transcription 
rest you can download any example videos or podcasts just make sure that they are in the mp3 format or mp4
 

Do read this to run this project properly
 
this demo video is also inculded.
thankyou.
