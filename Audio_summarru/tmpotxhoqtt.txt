Music
Let him up, let him up, tell me where you are, tell me where you are
So nice and bright lights in the shooting stores, they bring my heart
Calling it out, you're not picking up, shadows so close, they've cast the love
Let him edge, let him edge, baby in the dark, show me where you are
Oh, I love you, oh, I love you
How much you have to wait, how much you know, you know, you're speaking
So, oh, I love you, tell me there's a real rock
Cause when you know, we'll bring you back to me
Cause I don't know why to love someone else
I don't know what to forget, your face
Oh, I love you, I've got to miss you, maybe some of the night
So far
So far
It's breakin' me, I'm losing you, we move far from perfect
But we were worth it
So many fights and we cry, but never said we're sorry
So I'm sayin' you love me, you calling me now, but I can't pick up
And shed us so close and I still love
This song is over now, somehow still breaks my heart
We could have had to stop
Oh, I love you, how much you have to wait, how much you know, you know, you're speaking
Oh, I love you, tell me there's a real rock
Cause when you know, we'll bring you back to me
Cause I don't know why to love someone else
I don't know what to forget, your face
Oh, I love you, I've got to miss you, maybe some of the night
So far
So far
Don't fall away
Oh, I love you, I love you, don't fall away
So far away
