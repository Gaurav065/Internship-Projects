- Dataset has been taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghavrpotdar/fresh-and-stale-images-of-fruits-and-vegetables

- There is a webb application created for testing the accuracy of model. Since we are using stale and fresh dataset it should work on photos other than the mentioned picturs and dataset, although it will only detect the mntioned classes only.
- This particular architecture can be used in the classification of other data as well as long as you have the dataset 

# Libs
